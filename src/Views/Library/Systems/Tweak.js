                        The TweakSequenceAsset class is a fundamental scriptable object that plays a
                        pivotal role within the Magikus Tweak System. It serves as a powerful tool for developers
                        to create and orchestrate sequences of tweaks, enabling the application of specific and
                        intricate effects to GameObjects over a predefined period. This class empowers
                        developers with a high degree of control over the temporal evolution of GameObject
                        properties, fostering captivating and dynamic experiences within Unity projects.

                    <p>
                        At its core, the TweakSequenceAsset acts as a container for an ordered series of
                        tweaks, defining the sequence and behavior of each applied effect. Developers can
                        meticulously design sequences that include a variety of tweaks, such as position
                        modifications, rotation alterations, scale adjustments, or even color transitions. These
                        sequences are then executed by the TweakManager script, facilitating smooth and
                        continuous animations or visual changes across multiple GameObjects simultaneously.
